<h1><span class="sp1">There Is A Reaper ...</span></h1>

<h2><i>By<br />
Charles V. De Vet</i></h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><big><b>Doctors had given him just one month to
live. A month to wonder, what comes afterward?
There was one way to find out&mdash;ask a dead man!</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> amber brown of the
liquor disguised the poison it
held, and I watched with a
smile on my lips as he drank it.
There was no pity in my heart for
him. He was a jackal in the jungle
of life, and I ... I was one of
the carnivores. It is the lot of the
jackals of life to be devoured by
the carnivore.</p>

<p>Suddenly the contented look
on his face froze into a startled
stillness. I knew he was
feeling the first savage twinge
of the agony that was to
come. He turned his head and
looked at me, and I saw suddenly
that he knew what I had done.</p>

<p>"You murderer!" he cursed me,
and then his body arched in the
middle and his voice choked off
deep in his throat.</p>

<p>For a short minute he sat, tense,
his body stiffened by the agony
that rode it&mdash;unable to move a
muscle. I watched the torment in
his eyes build up to a crescendo of
pain, until the suffering became so
great that it filmed his eyes, and
I knew that, though he still stared
directly at me, he no longer saw
me.</p>

<p>Then, as suddenly as the spasm
had come, the starch went out of
his body and his back slid slowly
down the chair edge. He landed
heavily with his head resting limply
against the seat of the chair.
His right leg doubled up in a kind
of jerk, before he was still.</p>

<p>I knew the time had come.
"Where are you?" I asked.</p>

<p>This moment had cost me sixty
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Three weeks ago the best doctors
in the state had given me a
month to live. And with seven
million dollars in the bank I couldn't
buy a minute more.</p>

<p>I accepted the doctors' decision
philosophically, like the gambler
that I am. But I had a plan: One
which necessity had never forced
me to use until now. Several years
before I had read an article about
the medicine men of a certain tribe
of aborigines living in the jungles
at the source of the Amazon River.
They had discovered a process in
which the juice of a certain bush&mdash;known
only to them&mdash;could be
used to poison a man. Anyone subjected
to this poison died, but for
a few minutes after the life left his
body the medicine men could still
converse with him. The subject,
though ostensibly and actually
dead, answered the medicine men's
every question. This was their
primitive, though reportedly effective
method of catching glimpses of
what lay in the world of death.</p>

<div class="figr"><img src="images/001.png" width="370" height="500" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>I had conceived my idea at the
time I read the article, but I had
never had the need to use it&mdash;until
the doctors gave me a month to
live. Then I spent my sixty thousand
dollars, and three weeks later
I held in my hands a small bottle
of the witch doctors' fluid.</p>

<p>The next step was to secure my
victim&mdash;my collaborator, I preferred
to call him.</p>

<p>The man I chose was a nobody.
A homeless, friendless non-entity,
picked up off the street. He had
once been an educated man. But
now he was only a bum, and when
he died he'd never be missed. A
perfect man for my experiment.</p>

<p>I'm a rich man because I have
a system. The system is simple:
I never make a move until I know
exactly where that move will lead
me. My field of operations is the
stock market. I spend money unstintingly
to secure the information
I need before I take each step. I
hire the best investigators, bribe
employees and persons in position
to give me the information I want,
and only when I am as certain as
humanly possible that I cannot be
wrong do I move. And the system
never fails. Seven million dollars
in the bank is proof of that.</p>

<p>Now, knowing that I could not
live, I intended to make the system
work for me one last time before
I died. I'm a firm believer in the
adage that any situation can be
whipped, given prior knowledge of
its coming&mdash;and, of course, its attendant
circumstances.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">For</span> a moment he did not answer
and I began to fear that
my experiment had failed. "Where
are you?" I repeated, louder and
sharper this time.</p>

<p>The small muscles about his
eyes puckered with an unnormal
tension while the rest of his face
held its death frost. Slowly, slowly,
unnaturally&mdash;as though energized
by some hyper-rational power&mdash;his
lips and tongue moved.
The words he spoke were clear. "I
am in a ... a ... tunnel," he
said. "It is lighted, dimly, but
there is nothing for me to see."
Blue veins showed through the
flesh of his cheeks like watermarks
on translucent paper.</p>

<p>He paused and I urged, "Go
on."</p>

<p>"I am alone," he said. "The
realities I knew no longer exist,
and I am damp and cold. All about
me is a sense of gloom and dejection.
It is an apprehension&mdash;an
emanation&mdash;so deep and real as
to be almost a tangible thing. The
walls to either side of me seem to
be formed, not of substance, but
rather of the soundless cries of
melancholy of spirits I cannot see.</p>

<p>"I am waiting, waiting in the
gloom for something which will
come to me. That need to wait
is an innate part of my being and
I have no thought of questioning
it." His voice died again.</p>

<p>"What are you waiting for?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know," he said, his
voice dreary with the despair of
centuries of hopelessness. "I only
know that I must wait&mdash;that compulsion
is greater than my strength
to combat."</p>

<p>The tone of his voice changed
slightly. "The tunnel about me
is widening and now the walls have
receded into invisibility. The tunnel
has become a plain, but the
plain is as desolate, as forlorn and
dreary as was the tunnel, and still
I stand and wait. How long must
this go on?"</p>

<p>He fell silent again, and I was
about to prompt him with another
question&mdash;I could not afford to let
the time run out in long silences&mdash;but
abruptly the muscles about his
eyes tightened and subtly a new
aspect replaced their hopeless dejection.
Now they expressed a
black, bottomless terror. For a
moment I marveled that so small
a portion of a facial anatomy could
express such horror.</p>

<p>"There is something coming toward
me," he said. "A&mdash;beast&mdash;of
brutish foulness! Beast is too
inadequate a term to describe it,
but I know no words to tell its
form. It is an intangible and evasive&mdash;thing&mdash;but
very real. And it
is coming closer! It has no organs
of sight as I know them, but I feel
that it can see me. Or rather that
it is aware of me with a sense sharper
than vision itself. It is very
near now. Oh God, the malevolence,
the hate&mdash;the potentiality of
awful, fearsome destructiveness
that is its very essence! And still
I cannot move!"</p>

<p>The expression of terrified anticipation,
centered in his eyes, lessened
slightly, and was replaced, instantly,
by its former deep, deep
despair. "I am no longer afraid,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Why?" I interjected. "Why?"
I was impatient to learn all that
I could before the end came.</p>

<p>"Because ..." He paused.
"Because it holds no threat for
me. Somehow, someday, I understand&mdash;I
know&mdash;that it too is seeking
that for which I wait."</p>

<p>"What is it doing now?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"It has stopped beside me and
we stand together, gazing across
the stark, empty plain. Now a second
awful entity, with the same
leashed virulence about it, moves
up and stands at my other side.
We all three wait, myself with a
dark fear of this dismal universe,
my unnatural companions with patient,
malicious menace.</p>

<p>"Bits of ..." He faltered. "Of
... I can name it only <i>aura</i>, go
out from the beasts like an acid
stream, and touch me, and the hate,
and the venom chill my body like
a wave of intense cold.</p>

<p>"Now there are others of the
awful breed behind me. We stand,
waiting, waiting for that which
will come. What it is I do not
know."</p>

<p>I could see the pallor of death
creeping steadily into the last
corners of his lips, and I knew that
the end was not far away. Suddenly
a black frustration built up
within me. "What are you waiting
for?" I screamed, the tenseness,
and the importance of this moment
forcing me to lose the iron self-control
upon which I have always
prided myself. I knew that the
answer held the secret of what I
must know. If I could learn that,
my experiment would not be in
vain, and I could make whatever
preparations were necessary for my
own death. I had to know that
answer.</p>

<p>"Think! Think!" I pleaded.
"What are you waiting for?"</p>

<p>"I do not know!" The dreary
despair in his eyes, sightless as they
met mine, chilled me with a coldness
that I felt in the marrow of
my being. "I do not know," he
repeated. "I ... Yes, I do know!"</p>

<p>Abruptly the plasmatic film
cleared from his eyes and I knew
that for the first time, since the
poison struck, he was seeing me,
clearly. I sensed that this was
the last moment before he left&mdash;for
good. It had to be now!</p>

<p>"Tell me. I command you," I
cried. "What are you waiting
for?"</p>

<p>His voice was quiet as he murmured,
softly, implacably, before
he was gone.</p>

<p>"We are waiting," he said, "for
<i>you</i>."</p>
